KELT-1b is located in the Andromeda constellation and is so massive that it has also been called the "failed star" planet.
It's a super hot, dense ball of hydrogen that is so close to its star it makes a 'yearly orbit' in a little over a single Earth day.
It is most comparable to a brown dwarf classification
Is blasted by about 6 thousand times the radiation Earth gets
